Child mortality is a major global health issue, with malaria as one of the leading preventable causes of death for children under five. 
Preventive measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), are promoted by global organizations like UNICEF and WHO. 
This project examines whether more access to these measures correlates with lower child mortality across countries. 
Additionally, we aim to examine changes in malaria-related cases over time to determine whether the prevalence of malaria is decreasing, stable, or showing spikes in recent years.
