Child mortality is a major global health issue, with malaria as one of the leading preventable causes of death for children under five. 
Preventive measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), are promoted by global organizations like UNICEF and WHO. 
This project examines whether more access to these measures correlates with lower child mortality across countries. 
Additionally, we aim to examine changes in malaria-related cases over time to determine whether the prevalence of malaria is decreasing, stable, or showing spikes in recent years.

## What datasets did we use?

1. UNICEF Malaria & Child Health Dataset (https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/malaria/)
2. World Bank Under-5 Mortality Data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?)
3. World Bank Incidence of Malaria (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MLR.INCD.P3?name_desc=true)

## What is df_latest_by_country.csv, and how did we get it? 

1. df_latest_by_country.csv is the file we used for our final evaluation and analysis. 
2. We merged both datasets and selected the most recent data entry for every country. 
3. After doing that, we got the df_latest_by_country.csv file.
